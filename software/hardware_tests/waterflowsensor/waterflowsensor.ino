// reading liquid flow rate using Seeeduino and Water Flow Sensor from Seeedstudio.com
// Code adapted by Charles Gantt from PC Fan RPM code written by Crenn @thebestcasescenario.com
// http:/themakersworkbench.com http://thebestcasescenario.com http://seeedstudio.com

/* For YF-S401 the values are:
The inner diameter 1.5mm. (Black) Frequency: F = 98 * Q (Q is flow L / min) error: Â± 5 stream End liters of water output 5880 pulse

Frequency calculation = constant * unit flow (L / min) * time (seconds)

Flow Range :0.3-6L / min  

In order to avoid the instantaneous current is too large, burned flow sensor,please use DC3.5V-12V voltage.
